### Introduction
#### Hey there, this is the repository for a 2-player Delta Robot Arm driven Tic-Tac-Toe game by Logan and Cole. 

Here is an explaination on how things are meant to go:
The 1st player presses one of the buttons on the 9 button panel, press a button twice to accept a move, and the Delta Robot Arm will move the playing pieces were they need to go. After that, the 2nd player will select were they want to go.
